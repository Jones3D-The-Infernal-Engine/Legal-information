# Legal-informations

This project is dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine modding. All mods, levels, tools in this project are fan-creations, it's free and not supported by LucasArts/Disney. To use this stuff, you must buy a legal version of the original game distributed on (for example):

Gog:
https://www.gog.com/game/indiana_jones_and_the_infernal_machine

Steam:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/904540/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Infernal_Machine/

Please Disney, it's a fan project running on the original game engine. So if any mods improve the game, players will be tempted to buy the original game, and only you will be getting the money. We don't want money...
