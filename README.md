# Legal-informations

Dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine modding. Everything created is free and not supported by LucasArts/Disney. These mods, levels and tools only work if you have purchased a legal version of the original game distributed by LucasArts/Disney on:

Gog:
https://www.gog.com/game/indiana_jones_and_the_infernal_machine

Steam:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/904540/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Infernal_Machine/

Please Disney, it's a fan project based on the original engine. If any mods improve the game, players will be tempted to buy it, and only you will be getting the money.
